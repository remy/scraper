## 2.2.0

- **New**: Automatic cron-based script scheduling
  - Scripts can export `export const cron = "<expression>"` to run automatically
  - Cron format: `minute hour day month weekday` (e.g., `"0 */6 * * *"` for every 6 hours)
  - Scheduled runs receive `context.isScheduled: true` (no `request`/`response` objects)
  - All cron expressions validated at startup and logged
- **New**: Automatic schedule reloading with file watcher
  - Monitors script directory for changes (add, edit, delete, rename)
  - Debounces reloads with 60-second grace period to avoid excessive reloads during rapid edits
  - Gracefully stops old tasks and registers new schedules
- **New**: Execution queue for concurrent access control
  - Prevents Puppeteer conflicts by limiting to one script execution at a time
  - Multiple requests automatically queued (FIFO) with position and wait time logging
  - Both scheduled and manual API calls use the same queue
- **New**: Graceful shutdown handling
  - Proper cleanup of cron tasks, file watcher, execution queue on process termination (SIGTERM/SIGINT)
  - Handles uncaught exceptions with full resource cleanup
  - All shutdown events logged with `[SCHEDULER]` prefix
- **Improved**: File existence validation before scheduled script execution
- **Improved**: Concurrent reload protection to prevent multiple simultaneous reloads
- **Improved**: Comprehensive logging for queue, scheduler, and shutdown events with `[QUEUE]` and `[SCHEDULER]` prefixes
